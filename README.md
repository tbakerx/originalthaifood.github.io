Website for Original Thai Food restaurant for a friend in Ao Nang Beach, Krabi, Thailand

During my travels throughout Southeast Asia I ended up in Ao Nang Beach in Krabi, Thailand for a while and found a great little restaurant right across the street from my hotel. The lady that ran the place was the sweetest person I've ever met. It was not a big place, and they did not have very many customers but the food was amazing. I realized that they did not really have any online presence as is common in Thailand but can be a huge business booster with the number of connected travellers searching online for recommendations in the new places that they visit.

After being treated so well by the owners (like the best service I've ever experienced) I discussed with them about getting them up on Google Maps. They were very thankful for this and it felt really good to help out.

I've since left that area but we stay in touch as well as we can with the major language barrier. This is going to be my surprise to them for making my time in their area so pleasant :)

If anybody finds this and feels like jumping in and helping out feel free! All that I request is that you send me a message to let me know who you are and a bit about yourself.
